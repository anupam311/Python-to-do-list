# Future Improvements — Python To-Do List

The Python To-Do List application can be enhanced in several meaningful ways to extend its functionality:

## 1. Permanent Data Storage
- Save tasks to a text file, JSON file, or database so that tasks persist even after the program closes.

## 2. Add Priority Levels
- Allow users to assign Low, Medium, or High priority to tasks.

## 3. Add Due Dates
- Add the ability to set deadlines for tasks and highlight overdue tasks.

## 4. Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Use a library like Tkinter or PyQt to convert the console app into a more user-friendly GUI application.

## 5. Search Bar
- Allow users to search for specific tasks by keywords.

## 6. Color Coding for Terminal Output
- Use simple color codes to differentiate between completed and pending tasks for better readability.

## 7. Sorting Options
- Sort tasks by priority, date, or completion status.

Implementing these features would significantly improve the usability and practicality of the To-Do List program.
