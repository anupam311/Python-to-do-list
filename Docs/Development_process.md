# Development Process — Python To-Do List

## Step 1: Project Setup
- Opened Visual Studio Code and created a folder named `python-todo-list`.
- Created the main Python file `todo.py`.
- Installed and configured Git for version control.

## Step 2: Creating the Menu System
- Implemented a loop-based menu that continuously prompts the user with options:
  1. Add Task
  2. View Tasks
  3. Delete Task
  4. Mark Task as Done
  5. Exit
- Added input handling to allow the user to navigate the program easily.

## Step 3: Building Core Features
### Add Task
- Implemented functionality to input a new task and store it in a list as a dictionary with fields for task name and status.

### View Tasks
- Displayed all tasks with their task number and completion status.

### Delete Task
- Allowed users to remove tasks from the list using their task number.

### Mark Task as Done
- Updated a task's status from "Pending" to "Done".

## Step 4: Code Refinement and Cleanup
- Improved readability with comments and spacing.
- Added validation for user input to avoid errors.
- Ensured proper looping and exit conditions.

## Step 5: Git Workflow
- Initialized the repository using `git init`.
- Made at least five meaningful commits at different stages of development.
- Pushed the code to GitHub using `git remote add origin` and `git push`.

This structured development approach ensures clarity, readability, and efficient version tracking.
